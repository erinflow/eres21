# Schedule

To be announced mid April.

Most of the time will be dedicated to _contributed talks_.
There will be a _virtual poster session_.

We will also invite a few speakers for _discussion panels_, to be held on the
topics of career development and public engagement respectively.

Finally, there will be time for _interacting_ with each other in an
unstructured way. As we would in meatspace.
