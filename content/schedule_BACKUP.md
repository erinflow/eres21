# Schedule

The full schedule will be announced in mid April.

Most of the time will be dedicated to _contributed talks_.
There will be a _virtual poster session_.

There will also be _two discussion panels_, to be held on the topics of career
development and public engagement.  For our public engagement panel, we look
forward to welcoming [Mark
Newhouse](https://www.noao.edu/outreach/epostaff/mark) (NOIRLab/Gemini Observatory), [Jessie
Christiansen](http://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/christia/) (Caltech IPAC/NExScI), and [David Kipping](http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~dkipping/index.html) (Columbia).  For our
career development panel, we will be welcoming [Megan
Shabram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meganshabram) (Bountiful), [Ian
Czekala](https://sites.psu.edu/iczekala/) (Penn State), and [Susan Mullally](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/research-directory/susan-e-mullally) (STScI).

Finally, there will be time for _interacting_ with each other in an
unstructured way. As we would in person!
