## How does ERES differ from a typical conference?

The ERES meeting is explicitly designed for and by "emerging" researchers,
including graduate students, postdocs, and advanced undergraduates. The vast
majority of the scientific talks will be given by postdocs and PhD students.
The scientific discussion will also be driven by junior scientists.  Although
most of the time will be devoted to scientific talks, the organizing committee
is also planning a few panel discussions on professional development topics.  A
poster session will also be held, within a virtual conference hall.

## Will it be just postdocs and PhD students?
Senior researchers and undergraduates are also encouraged to register and
attend.  We do envision though that the majority of the scientific talks will
be given by PhD students and postdocs, and that the scientific discussion will
be driven by junior scientists.

## How long will the talks be?
Final decisions will be made once the organizing committee reviews the
abstracts submitted. Based on the number of prospective participants
expressing interest in giving a talk, we anticipate that most talks (Q+A) will
be 15 minutes (to mimic AAS dissertation talks).

## Are there preferred topics for talks?
The session topics will be chosen to reflect the abstracts submitted. Weâ€™re
interpreting exoplanetary science broadly.  Possible topics include:
* Detection: transits, RVs, imaging, microlensing, astrometry, etc.
* Planet formation and evolution
* Architectures & dynamics
* Planetary atmospheres and interiors
* Brown dwarfs
* Disks (protostellar, protoplanetary, and debris)
* Host stars
* Instrumentation
* Statistical characterization
* Habitability & biosignatures
* Future missions & observatories.

## How many people are you expecting?
Previous ERES meetings have hosted 80-150 people.  This one is online, which
makes accommodating more people easier.  We'll see what happens!

## Any recommendations for presenters?
Before preparing your talk, we recommend skimming [Winn's guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TqGwFQTdO0bEzBFMZ6vY4jlH7zkBcTCbuF0r4YmRP5E/edit?usp=sharing).
