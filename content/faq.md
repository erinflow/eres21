## How does ERES differ from a typical conference?

The ERES meeting is explicitly designed for and by "emerging" researchers,
including graduate students, postdocs, and advanced undergraduates. The vast
majority of the scientific talks will be given by postdocs and PhD students.
The scientific discussion will also be driven by junior scientists.  Although
most of the time will be devoted to scientific talks, the organizing committee
is also planning a few panel discussions on professional development topics.  A
poster session will also be held, within a virtual conference hall.


## Will it be just postdocs and PhD students?

Senior researchers and undergraduates are also encouraged to register and
attend.  We do envision though that the majority of the scientific talks will
be given by PhD students and postdocs, and that the scientific discussion will
be driven by junior scientists.


## How long will the talks be?

Final decisions will be made once the organizing committee reviews the
abstracts submitted. Based on the number of prospective participants
expressing interest in giving a talk, we anticipate that most talks (Q+A) will
be 15 minutes (to mimic AAS dissertation talks).


## Are there preferred topics for talks?

The session topics will be chosen to reflect the abstracts submitted. We’re
interpreting exoplanetary science broadly.  Possible topics include:
* Detection: transits, RVs, imaging, microlensing, astrometry, etc.
* Planet formation and evolution
* Architectures & dynamics
* Planetary atmospheres and interiors
* Brown dwarfs
* Disks (protostellar, protoplanetary, and debris)
* Host stars
* Instrumentation
* Statistical characterization
* Habitability & biosignatures
* Future missions & observatories.


## How will talk slots be assigned from the pool of applicants?

Talk slots will preferentially be given to emerging researchers, prioritizing
more junior graduate students (years 1-2) before senior graduate students
(years 3+) and postdocs.  If the talk slots are heavily oversubscribed, some
preference will be given to applicants from schools in the northeast area to
preserve the regional focus of the ERES conference series.  Students and
researchers from all career stages and geographic locations are encouraged to
register for ERES and join in on conference activities and scientific
discussions.


## How many people are you expecting?

Previous ERES meetings have hosted 80-150 people.  This one is online, which
makes accommodating more people easier.  We'll see what happens!


## Any recommendations for presenters?

Before preparing your talk, we recommend skimming [Winn's
guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TqGwFQTdO0bEzBFMZ6vY4jlH7zkBcTCbuF0r4YmRP5E/edit?usp=sharing).


## What are other local talk opportunities?

Those interested in giving a talk at any of the ERES host
institutions--Cornell, Penn State, Princeton, Yale--are invited to coordinate
with the organizers of institution-specific talk opportunities.

Cornell hosts a weekly Planetary Lunch Seminary Series (PLunch), an informal
seminar series presented to faculty members, research associates, graduate
students, and undergraduate students from various academic departments.  For
further information, please email Ngoc Truong (tnt45@cornell.edu).

The Penn State Center for Exoplanets & Habitable Worlds (CEHW) hosts a [weekly
lunch](https://exoplanets.psu.edu/events-page/seminars/) seminar that invites
outside speakers to present.  Please contact Dan Stevens (danstevens@psu.edu)
for more information. 

Princeton hosts an [exoplanet
meeting](https://web.astro.princeton.edu/events/seminars/extrasolar-planets)
every Monday at noon that invites outside speakers to present. Please contact
Josh Winn (jnwinn@princeton.edu) for more information. A separate speaking
opportunity at Princeton is “[Thunch](https://web.astro.princeton.edu/Thunch)”.
Please contact Roberto Tejada Arevalo (arevalo@princeton.edu) for further
information.

Yale hosts a weekly Exoplanets and Stars Seminar that invites outside speakers
to present to graduate students, postdocs, and faculty; please contact Malena
Rice (malena.rice@yale.edu) for more information.
