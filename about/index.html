<p>We are pleased to announce the sixth Emerging Researchers in Exoplanet
Science Symposium (ERES), to be held May 24-26, 2021.</p>
<p>ERES is aimed at early career scientists (graduate student, postdoc, advanced
undergraduate) working in all branches of exoplanetary science and related
disciplines. Its purpose is to give these emerging researchers the opportunity
to present their research to an interested audience, to provide
opportunities to network with peers, and to enhance collaborations within the
exoplanet community.</p>
<p>ERES has been held annually on a rotating basis between partner institutions
since 2015 (see
<a href="http://eres2014.github.io/">1</a>,<a href="https://exoplanets.psu.edu/eres-2016/">2</a>,<a href="http://eres-yale.science/2017/">3</a>,<a href="https://sites.psu.edu/eres2018/">4</a>,<a href="http://eres.astro.cornell.edu/">5</a>).
Current partners include Cornell, Penn State, Princeton, and Yale.</p>
<p>In 2021, we had hoped to organize an in-person conference at Princeton. We
expect however that the online format will provide many benefits.  Along with
plenary sessions, the event will include discussion panels, focused on career
development and public engagement respectively.  There will also be a virtual
poster session, and time for lightly structured interaction via
<a href="https://gather.town">gather.town</a>.</p>
<p>The event is scheduled for <strong>1-5pm Eastern, May 24-26, 2021</strong>.
It will be <strong>live and synchronous</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://eres2021.com/register/">abstract submission</a> deadline is <strong>April
2, 2021</strong>, at 5pm Eastern.</p>
